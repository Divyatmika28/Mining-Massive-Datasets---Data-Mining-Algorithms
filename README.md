 SON Algorithm,Frequent Itemsets,  Recommendation systems, BFR, AMS, Twitter Streaming,Streaming, Bloom Filter, Community Detection using Modularity, Girvan-Newman Algorithm implementation in Spark-Python. 

HW1 - Yelp Dataset Exploration using PySprak. Demonstration of Partitioning the data using Spark. 

HW2 - Implementation of SON algorithm using Apache Spark Framework(Python). 
Program finds the frequent itemsets in Yelp Dataset. 
   1. Reading the user_business CSV file in to RDD and then build the case 1 market-basket model; 
   2. Find out qualified users who reviewed more than k businesses. (k is the filter threshold);
   3. Apply the SON algorithm code to the filtered market-basket model;
   
   
HW3 Implement LSH, And Recommendation systems on Yelp Dataset 
   Case 1: Model-based CF recommendation system with Spark MLlib 
   Case 2: User-based CF recommendation system
   Case 3: Item-based CF recommendation system 
   Case 4: Item-based CF recommendation system with Jaccard based LSH
   
   
HW4 Community Detection on Yelp dataset using Girvan-Newman Algorithma and Modularity 
  
HW5 Implementation of BFR Clustering using Apache Spark Framework (in an distributed environment)
  
HW6 -  Implementation of Bloom Filtering and Flajolet- Martin algorithm with Spark Steaming. Some analysis on Twitter stream using Fixed Size Sample (Reservoir Sampling).
